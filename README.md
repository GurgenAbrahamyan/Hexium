# Hexium

A lightweight C++ engine focused on learning graphics,
physics, and engine architecture.

## Features
- OpenGL renderer
- Basic texture manager (in progress)
- Rigid body physics (WIP)
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux planned)

## Roadmap / Future Plans
- Collision detection system (AABB, Sphere, later OBB)
- Broad-phase & narrow-phase collision pipeline
- Improved texture manager (caching, async loading)
- Physically Based Rendering (PBR)
- Material system
- Basic lighting (directional, point lights)
- Debug rendering (collision shapes, forces)
- Engine-wide math & unit conventions documentation
